Agricultural fields are often very heterogenous, and one when we intend to determine the genetic value of a given set of genotype, it is often useful to use methods that account for this variability [@singh2003spatial]. Several methodological and statistical approaches can be used to address this use. In this chaper, we will cover the use of **SpATS**, and (hopefully soon) the use of other packages. 

## SpATS

SpATS (Spatial Analysis of field Trials with Splines) is an approach for spatial analysis developed by @spats2017. In general, it uses the row-column "two-dimensional
smooth surfaces to model random spatial variation". The proper explanation of the statistics behind can be found [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211675317301070?casa_token=vtmG6I6PWwsAAAAA:UXWSox0zDSMUU3wnJfCEvtBFbTrW4FK1EOdf-GT6O00G1MVMWpMRLNevjzVwRDNf71y46ml6) and [here](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00122-017-2894-4). 


As usual, before using the package, it must be installed.
```{r, eval = F}
install.packages("SpATS")
```

And then called:
```{r, message= F, warning= F}
library (SpATS)
```

We will use the same tomato data that we have been using in the previous chapter.

```{r,  message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results=F}
mydata <- read.csv("tomatoMLT2020.csv")
```


So, to properly perform the analysis, we can only use data from one location, in order to grasp the spatial heterogeneity of that specific farm. So, we first [subset](#basic-r) the data only from Sestola, one of our four locations.

```{r, message= F, warning= F}
data.Sestola <- subset(mydata, location == "Sestola")
```

With this object, we can now run the function **SpATS**, as showed and explained here:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results=F}
spats.Sestola  =    SpATS(data=      data.Sestola,    # My subset from Sestola  
                          response= "yield",          # The name of my variable
                          genotype = "variety",       # The name of my genotupe columns
                          genotype.as.random = F,     # This is a long story. 
                                                      # But this argument determines if
                                                      # genotypes set as random or as fixed in my model.
                                                      # In the first case, I will obtain BLUPs 
                                                      # values, and in the second, BLUEs values.
                          spatial = ~ SAP(row, col))  # This arguments designs the row-column distribution of the field

```

We created an object called "spats.Sestola" and we can plot it inmediately. In this plot we can see the raw data, the data "fitted" to the spatial model, the residuals of the model, the smoothed spatial trend and the BLUES values.

```{r myplotSestola, message= F, warning= F}
plot(spats.Sestola)
```

We are intereseted in the BLUES (or the BLUPS), which is an estimate (or a prediction) of the breeding genetic value for each genotype. In the plot, they are given as a deviation from the mean. If we add the overall mean value to that number, we would have what we call an adjusted mean. In SpATS, this can be done through **predict()**.

```{r, message= F, warning= F}
adj.means = predict(spats.Sestola, which = 'variety')
adj.means
```

And now, I could plot this adjusted means with [ggplot](#ggplot).

```{r sestolaadjmeans, message= F, warning= F}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(adj.means, aes(x= variety, y = predicted.values))+
  geom_bar(stat= "identity", fill = "tomato")+
  geom_errorbar( aes(ymax = predicted.values+ standard.errors,
                     ymin = predicted.values- standard.errors))
```


To better understand the kind of transformation that we did to the data, we can take a look at this plot, which represents the raw yield numbers for each plot in the field.

```{r rawSestola, message= F, warning= F}
ggplot(data.Sestola, aes(x=row, y = col, label= variety, fill = yield))+
  geom_tile()+
  geom_text()+
  scale_fill_gradientn(colors=c("blue", "lightblue", "green3", "yellow", "red"))
```

We can see some examples, for instance:

* Var. D was the best variety. It had an outstanding performance in Column 6 Row 1 and then, an average performance in Row 3 Column 4. The combination of both performances allowed this variety to have the highest BLUE value.

* Var. H had the lowest adjusted mean. Both repetitions were more or less in the center of the plot, but both had bad performances. At the end, we end up with a very low BLUE value.

Moreover, the SpATS object we have just created is full of different objects, that could be further explored, for example":

```{r, eval = F}
spats.Sestola$call       # The original call
spats.Sestola$model      # The parameters of the model
spats.Sestola$deviance   # The deviance indicate how appropiate is the fitting of the model.
spats.Sestola$coeff      # This is the coefficient for every factor, including genotype and field position.
```

We then would have to do the same for every environment. We could do it manually, writing the code above for every environment. It is possible, but lenghty.

We will here propose the code to do through a loop function. Looping in R (and in general) is extremely useful, and we will use this example to show the basics on how looping is done.

First, we create a list of the elements that will be used in my loop. In our case, the list will contain the 4 location name. Alternatively, and most commonly, the lists are simply a sequence of numbers.

```{r}
mylocs = unique(mydata$loc) # The unique() function takes the unique values from a vector
mylocs
```

Now, we will draw the loop. The main function is **for()** followed by curly braces {}. The **for()** defines a how to go over the loop. We will write **for (i in mylocs)** meaning that *i* is a variable that will take the value of each one of the elements in my list (the location names). And then, everything inside the curly braces is what will be done with i being a given value within the list


```{r, results = "hide", message= F, results = F}
for (i in mylocs){                                    # i is a variable that will take the value of every element in mylocs
  myenv = i                                           # Define "myenv" as whatever we have in i
  mysubset= subset(mydata, location == i)                     # Make a subset with environment i
  
  myspats =  SpATS(response = "yield",                # This is the SpATS function we saw before
                 genotype = "variety", 
                 genotype.as.random = F,
                 data=      mysubset,                 # The data is coming from the specific subset done within the loop
                spatial = ~ SAP(row, col))
  adjusted.means <- predict(myspats,                  #  With "myspats", we estimate the adjusted means
                            which = "variety")   
  adjusted.means$location <- myenv                         # To our "adjusted.means" data frame, we add a column with the name of environment                        
  assign(value  = adjusted.means[,c(6,1,4,5)],        # I want to save the adjusted means object (while also rearranging column order)
         x=  paste0("means.",myenv))                  # with a new name define as "means.myenv", where myenv is the actual name of the environment
}

```

The possibilities of looping are vast. We could, for example, create a new loop, within our main loop, for also obtaining the adjusted means for other variables. We will not do it for now.

Now, we have four different adjusted means object, one for each environment. We could bind the with the **rbind()** function, which stands for rowbind.

```{r}
all.means <- rbind(means.Castronuovo, means.Molise, means.Rotonda, means.Sestola)

#We can additionally change some column names to make things more clean
names(all.means)[3] <- "yield_adj_mean"
names(all.means)[4] <- "yield_sd"
```

And we plot it:


```{r myplotafterloop}
ggplot(data= all.means,                     # Our data frame
       aes(x=variety,                       # Variety is the x axis
           y=yield_adj_mean))+              # Yield Adjusted Means are the y axis
  geom_bar(stat='identity',                 # The bars are plotted according to the identity actual values in the cells
           fill= "tomato")+                 # and filled with "tomato" color
  facet_wrap(location~.)+                        # Make a facet per each location 
  labs(x= "Genotype",y= "Yield")  +         # Axis labels
  geom_errorbar(                            #Error bars
          aes(ymin=yield_adj_mean - yield_sd, 
              ymax=yield_adj_mean + yield_sd),
              width=0.2)+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle =90))
```


Moreover, given that ggplot can handle plotting data from two different data sources, we could do the same plot, but including also the raw data (in green), and check for the main differences between both.

```{r myplotafterloopcompare}
ggplot(data= all.means,                     # Our data frame
       aes(x=variety,                       # Variety is the x axis
           y=yield_adj_mean))+              # Yield Adjusted Means are the y axis
  geom_bar(stat='identity',                 # The bars are plotted according to the identity actual values in the cells
           fill= "tomato")+                 # and filled with "tomato" color
  facet_wrap(location~.)+                        # Make a facet per each location 
  labs(x= "Genotype",y= "Yield")  +         # Axis labels
  geom_errorbar(                            #Error bars
          aes(ymin=yield_adj_mean - yield_sd, 
              ymax=yield_adj_mean + yield_sd),
              width=0.2)+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle =90))+
  geom_point(data= mydata, aes(x= variety,y=yield), col= "darkgreen")+   # A point for every raw yield observation
  geom_point(data= mydata, aes(x= variety,y=yield), stat = "summary",    # And a cross for the mean of the rar observations.
             fun = "mean", col= "darkgreen", shape= 4)
```
