GGE Biplots are a useful tool for the analysis  multi environmental trials, that makes a special focus on the  Genetic and Genotype x Environment effects developed.  It consists mainly on a Principal Component Analysis (PCA), where the PC1 (x-axis) is proportional to the genetic effect and the PC2 (y-axis) to genotype x Environment effect @yan2000cultivar.


## metan

To our knowledge, the most complete package for the elaboration of GGE BiPlots "metan", developed by @Olivoto2020. Here, we will overview some of it's main functions, but the more complete description can be found at [their site](https://tiagoolivoto.github.io/metan/articles/vignettes_gge.html).

As usual, we must install (if it is not yet installed) and call the library:
```{r, eval = F}
install.packages("metan")
library(metan)
```

```{r, warning = F, message =F}
library(metan)

```

Then, we will use our tomato data, which we usually call 'mydata'.
```{r}
mydata <- read.csv("tomatoMLT2020.csv")
```

Now, before actually doing the plot, we prepare the GGE model with therequired parameters. In this case, we will use the yield variable. 

```{r}
gge_model <-  gge(mydata,             # My data set 
                  env = location,     # Column indicating the environment or location
                  gen = variety,      # Column indicating the genotype
                  resp= yield,        # Response column. For our case, we choose yield/
                  scaling = 1)        # Divides all value with the standard deviation, for proper scaling through environments.
```


After that, all we need is to plot.

```{r}
plot(gge_model)
```

We can interpret this plot in several different ways. However, one of the most evident things is that some environments are more similar than other. For example, Molise and Castronuovo are relatively close (and are thus very similar, regarding the performance of these genotypes), while Rotonda is very different from the rest. Moreover, genotypes closer to the environments indicate the their performance was better in that environment than at the others. A clear example is that of Var. M and Var. L for Sestola.
 

Here, we present the simplest version of the plot. But, the package includes other variants of the GGE BiPlots which might provide aditional information and/or interpretation.

### Which won where

The "Which-Won-Where" type draws a polygon along the genotypes that are the farthest away from the origin, this means that they are the genotypes with longest vectors and are thus the most responsive. As a rule of thumb, genotypes which are on the polygon vertex had the best performances in the environments found in the same sector @yan2000cultivar.

```{r ggemodel3}
plot(gge_model, type= 3)
```

### Mean vs. Stability

The "Mean vs. Stability" feature draws a first line, the mean environmental axis, passing through the origin with an arrow representing the "ideal" environment, and then a second line perpendicular to the first,  which represents the GxE interaction.  Genotypes with projections close to the arrow in the first axis would be high performers in this ideal environment,  while large projections on the second axis indicate low stability or high GxE interaction.

```{r}
plot(gge_model, type = 2)
```


### Genotype Ranking

The "ideal" genotype is represented as a small circle within a large set of concentric circles. How close the other gentoypes are to this circle determines how close are they to this "ideal" genotype.

```{r}
plot(gge_model, type = 8)
```

### Genotype Comparison

For this case, a line is drawn dividing the whole plot in two sectors, each contains one of the two genotypes compared. For each genotype, the environments contained within it's 'sector" of the plot, are the ones where it outperformed the other genotype.

```{r}
plot(gge_model,
     type = 9,
     sel_gen1 = "Var. A",
     sel_gen2 = "Var. L")
```    

### Modifying the plot.

Finally, metan produces plots that are already publication ready. It also offers a whole lot of modyfing possibilites that can be found in their [site](https://tiagoolivoto.github.io/metan/articles/vignettes_gge.html) or in the function description (that can be accesed by writing ?plot.gge).

However, if you want to modify other parameters, the GGE BiPlot is an object of the class "ggplot", so it can be easily modified through ggplot" functions. Some useful information for that matter can be found [here](http://r-statistics.co/Complete-Ggplot2-Tutorial-Part2-Customizing-Theme-With-R-Code.html). 

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
plot(gge_model,
     col.gen = "dimgray",  
     col.env = "red",                            # Changing the color of the labels for genotype and environment  
     size.text.env= 7,                           # Changing the size of the labels for genotype and environment
     size.text.gen = 5)+                         # The metan function arrives up to here, from now on, we add pieces
     labs(title = "My GGE Biplot")+              # 
  theme(title = element_text(size= 20),          # We can change the title or axis font size
        axis.title = element_text(size= 20)) 
```
